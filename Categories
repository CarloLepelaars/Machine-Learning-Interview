Machine Learning Interview

The first thing has to do with the algorithms and theory behind machine learning.
You'll have to show an understanding of how algorithms compare with one another and 
how to measure their efficacy and accuracy in the right way. 

The second category has to do with your programming skills and 
your ability to execute on top of those algorithms and the theory.

The third has to do with your general interest in machine learning: 
you’ll be asked about what’s going on in the industry and how you 
keep up with the latest machine learning trends. 

Finally, there are company or industry-specific questions that test 
your ability to take your general machine learning knowledge and 
turn it into actionable points to drive the bottom line forward.
